# User Management System as a RESTful Web Service

## Overview

The User Management System is a RESTful web service built using the Spring Boot framework. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing user data with a focus on scalability, performance, and maintainability.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Utilize a Spring Boot CRUD REST API to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user data.
- **DTO Pattern**: Implement Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern and mapping libraries to optimize data transfer between layers.
- **Exception Handling and Validation**: Ensure application robustness with effective exception handling strategies. Integrate Spring Boot's validation framework to enforce data integrity and prevent invalid data entries.
- **Monitoring and Documentation**: Integrate Spring Boot Actuator for real-time monitoring and management of application health. Thoroughly document the REST API endpoints using Spring Boot's API documentation tools.

## Key Technologies and Practices

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
